//! Behavior delegation. The protocol crate owns framing and dispatch;
//! the embedding host (tmuxify, kasaterm-sugarloaf-cli, etc.) plugs in
//! a `Backend` that translates method calls into actual terminal
//! operations.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally small. Methods that don't have a concrete
//! mapping yet (notifications, sidebar metadata) return a default
//! "unsupported" error from the dispatcher rather than forcing every
//! backend to stub them out — the trait grows as the feature set does.
